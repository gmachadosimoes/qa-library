 **QA Library Project**
 
 This is project created for learning purposes. It aims at creating a simple CRUD application based in Python using the Flask framework, and the basic idea is to create an application where the user have access to a library of articles on the subject of software quality and testing.

 **Why not building a crawler instead?**

 For two basic reasons. First of all, I wanted to work on a CRUD project; in addition to this, a crawler is basicly an application that doesn't count on human judgement and that is not what I wanted.

 This app is meant to have a curatorship work, therefore the human judgement is essential to establish the criteria of what articles, books etc. will be joining the library.

 In the future, depending on how the development work carries on, one feature I'd like to implement is a channel for users to submit articles they think should be part of this database.
